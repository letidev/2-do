# 2 Do

This project was made as a course project to a university discipline. It is a to do app with a fake backend, simulated with `json-server`.

Functionally there is login/register authentication, managing the todos and editing profile data.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To install all dependencies of the project. And then:

---

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

In order for the app to be functional, though, you must also start the `json-server` in another terminal with:

### `npm run start-server`

This stats the `json-server` on port `3005`.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. But, still, it will not be functional without the `json-server` running.
